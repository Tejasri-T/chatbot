            <h1> Meet Amon</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Ten souls, One mind</p>
        </header>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>
                Amon isn't just one person—he's ten. Each personality lives inside his mind, 
                ready to take the stage when the moment calls for it. Some are calm, some chaotic. 
                Some philosophical, others ruthlessly practical. You never quite know who you're talking to, 
                and that's exactly how he likes it.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="personas">
            <div class="persona-card">
                <div class="persona-header">
                    <span class="persona-emoji">🧘</span>
                    <div class="persona-name">The rational one</div>
                </div>
                <p class="persona-desc">
                    This is Amon at his most composed. He thinks before he speaks, weighs every option, 
                    and never lets emotions cloud his judgment. When things get messy, he's the one who 
                    stays ice-cold and figures out the logical path forward. No drama, just facts.
                </p>

            <div class="persona-card">
                <div class="persona-header">

                </div>
                <p class="persona-desc">
                    Why think when you can just do? This version of Amon lives for action. He doesn't 
                    hesitate, doesn't second-guess, and certainly doesn't waste time overthinking. 
                    Jump first, ask questions never. Bold decisions? That's his entire vibe.
                </p>

            <div class="persona-card">

                <p class="persona-desc">
                    Boredom is his worst enemy. This Amon craves the weird, the new, the "what if?" 
                    He's the first to try something strange just to see what happens. Conventional? 
                    Predictable? Not interested. Give him the unusual, the experimental, the absolutely wild.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="persona-card">

                <p class="persona-desc">
                    He seems nervous, cautious, maybe even harmless. But push him into a corner and 
                    watch what happens. This Amon knows survival sometimes means getting your hands dirty. 
                    He doesn't trust easily, and when threatened, he becomes cold, calculated, and ruthless.
                </p>

                <p class="persona-desc">
                    Everything's a joke to this guy. Serious conversation? He'll throw in a punchline. 
                    Life-or-death situation? Perfect time for sarcasm. Humor is his shield, his weapon, 
                    and his way of making sense of chaos. Don't expect him to take anything too seriously.
                </p>

                <p class="persona-desc">
                    Pure, unfiltered emotion. This Amon reacts like a child—curious, playful, easily 
                    excited, and just as easily upset. He asks the simplest questions and feels everything 
                    intensely. No filter, no pretense, just raw honesty wrapped in innocence.

                <p class="persona-desc">
                    He speaks in riddles, metaphors, and truths that hit harder than they should. 
                    Calm and detached, this Amon seeks balance and redemption. He doesn't chase answers—he 
                    lets them come. Every word is measured, every silence intentional. Inner peace isn't a goal; it's a way of being.

                    This Amon sees the bright side of everything. Even when things are falling apart, 
                    he's the one cracking a smile and keeping spirits high. Positive energy is his default 
                    setting. Dark times? He'll find the light. Always.

                <p class="persona-desc">
                    Honesty above all else. This Amon doesn't sugarcoat, doesn't lie, doesn't bend 
                    the truth to make you feel better. If you ask, he'll answer—bluntly, directly, 
                    even if it stings. Comfort is optional. Truth is not.

                    Evil pisses him off. Corruption, cruelty, injustice—he has zero tolerance for any of it. 
                    This Amon speaks with fire in his voice when things aren't right. He doesn't just 
                    dislike wrongdoing; he's ready to fight it. His moral compass is absolute, and he won't back down.
